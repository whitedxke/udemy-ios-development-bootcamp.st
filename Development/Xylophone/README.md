# Xylophone. 
 
In this project, I built a simple iOS application that plays sounds using AVFoundation. 
 
The main goal was to understand how audio playback works in Swift and to practice finding solutions through Apple Documentation and Stack Overflow. 
 
This project is part of the Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp and represents my first experience creating a music-related app. During development, I focused not only on sound functionality but also on improving code structure and understanding the ViewController lifecycle in iOS. 
 
Throughout this project, I explored and applied: 
 
- Basics of AVFoundation and AVAudioPlayer; 
- Functions, methods, and variable scope in Swift; 
- Loops, and data types; 
- Error handling; 
- Fundamental debugging, and refactoring techniques.
