# Networking, JSON Parsing, APIs and Core Location. 

Clima takes your app development skills to the next level by introducing live data fetching from the internet via APIs. This module bridges the gap between static apps and dynamic, data-driven experiences.

You will create a dark-mode enabled weather app, that provides weather updates for the user’s current location using GPS, as well as for manually searched cities.

Key Highlights:
- Build a dark-mode ready app using vector images for a polished UI;
- Capture and handle user input with UITextField and the delegate pattern;
- Explore Swift protocols, extensions, computed properties and the guard keyword;
- Use closures and completion handlers to manage asynchronous tasks;
- Fetch live data using URLSession and parse JSON with Encodable and Decodable;
- Apply Grand Central Dispatch to update the main thread safely;
- Integrate Core Location for location-based weather updates;
- Combine manual city search with automatic location detection for a complete user experience.

This stage expands your Swift knowledge into networking, asynchronous programming and location services, setting the foundation for fully interactive, real-world applications.
