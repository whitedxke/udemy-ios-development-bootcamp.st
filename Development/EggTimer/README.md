# Egg Timer. 
 
In this project, I built the EggTimer app — a simple iOS timer that helps you boil eggs to your preferred level of doneness. 
 
The main goal was to learn how to work with timers in Swift and to apply different data types and control flow statements to implement the app’s logic. 
 
This project served as a practical continuation of the previous module and helped me strengthen my ability to find solutions independently using Apple Documentation, Stack Overflow, and Google. 
 
Throughout this project, I explored and applied: 
 
- Swift collection types, including Dictionary; 
- The Timer API; 
- Conditional statements: if / else and switch; 
- Functions with return values; 
- UI component ProgressView.
