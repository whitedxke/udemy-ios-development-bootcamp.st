# Advanced Swift Programming - Classes, Inheritance & Advanced Optionals. 

Diving deeper into Advanced Swift Programming, exploring the power of Classes, Inheritance and the nuanced world of Optionals.

This stage refines understanding of object-oriented programming and the MVC design pattern, expanding beyond basic data structures into more dynamic and interactive app behavior.

Projects in this module include BMI Calculator and Tipsy — practical apps focusing on user input, calculation logic and elegant UI navigation.

Main goals:
- Strengthen understanding of Optionals and their safe handling;
- Explore the difference between Structs and Classes, including value vs. reference types;
- Implement multi-screen navigation with animations;
- Practice optional binding, optional chaining, and nil coalescing;
- Format data for user-friendly display;
- Apply color literals and refined UI elements;
- Build and complete the Advanced Swift Programming Challenge.
