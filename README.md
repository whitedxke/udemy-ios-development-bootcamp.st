# udemy:ios-development-bootcamp. 
  
Projects created during the «iOS Application Development Bootcamp» course on Udemy by Dr. Angela Yu (Developer, and Lead Instructor). The projects are written in Swift, using iOS-development tools, including UIKit and SwiftUI. 
 
The code has been adapted, and reworked by me based on the course materials. All projects were created independently.
